# Main Board

* The main board was made from some old phenolic resin perforated circuit board.

* The board was trackless (i.e. no copper tracks) and approximately 1.6 mm thick.

* The drawing shown is the design I ended up with after several attempts. It can definitely be optimised further to align the optics with the case and to make access to some of the nuts easier.
