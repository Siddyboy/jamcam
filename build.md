# James' Big Raspberry Pi Wildlife Camera Project

## Part Two - Build the Hardware

### Assemble the Raspberry Pi to the stand-offs

#### Parts
* Raspberry Pi (camera cable disconnected, but memory stick and micro SD card inserted)
* 4 off M2.5 x 6 M-F (brass) stand-offs
* 4 off M2.5 washers
* 4 off M2.5 cap head, hex socket screws

#### Assembly
* Turn off and unplug the Raspberry Pi power, keyboard, mouse, and display.
* Remove the camera cable from the Raspberry Pi.
* Leave the micro SD card and memory stick plugged in.
* Fix the four stand-offs to the Raspberry Pi using the washers and screws; the stand-offs should be on the same side as the micro-SD card.
* Do the screws up loosely for now; the stand-offs may need to move a little later.

### Prepare the small lens-and-camera holder

#### Parts
* Small plastic lens-and-camera holder
* 2 off M2 x 5 F-F (brass) stand-offs
* M4 x 20 cap head, hex socket screw
* Superglue or other contact adhesive

#### Assembly
* Machine the M4 screw:
  * Cut the thread length from 20 to 18.
  * Put a flat onto the head, almost through into the hex socket.
* Machine the plastic holder:
  * Increase the depth of the counterbore in the central fixing hole so that the screw will fit with its head below the concave surface.
  * Reduce the overall thickness by reducing one face flush with the recessed section. This ensures that the camera can get close enough to the lens.
  * On the other face remove the centre part of the circular arc only so that it is flush with the recessed section. This makes space for some of the parts on the camera board and ensures the camera sits flat on the holder.
  * Drill one hole in each arm of the holder.
    * From the face that was only partially machined.
    * At the widest part of the clip - i.e. across the full diameter.
    * Hole diameter to suit the stand-offs with a push fit.
    * Hole pitch to suit the Raspberry Pi Camera - 21 mm.
    * Depth to suit the stand-offs.
* Push the stand-offs into the holes just sub-flush with the surface.
* Enter the screw into the holder aligning the flat on the head with the completely machined surface.
* Glue the screw in position; you will not be able to access the head during assembly.
  
### Assemble the Raspberry Pi camera to the plastic holder

#### Parts
* Small plastic lens-and-camera holder (including captive screw and thread inserts)
* Raspberry Pi camera
* 2 off M2 washers
* 2 off M2 x 5 cap head, hex socket screws

#### Assembly
* Screw the camera to the holder using the screws and washers.
* The camera lens should point through the holder.
* The camera connector should point away from the flat end of the holder.
* Do not over-tighten the screws; the thread inserts may pull out of the holder.

### Assemble the zoom lens and Raspberry Pi camera to the main board

#### Parts
* Pre-cut perforated main board
* Small lens holder with camera attached
* Large plastic lens holder
* M4 x 20 countersunk head, hex socket screw
* 2 off M4 penny washers (~14 mm dia.)
* 2 off M4 nuts
* Zoom lens with lens covers fitted
* Rubber band

#### Assembly
* Cut the M4 screw from 20 to 17 overall length.
* Identify the slot cut in the main board for the camera cable.
* Rotate the main board so that the slot is on the left.
* Rotate the main board so that the longest edge of the board is at the bottom.
* Mount the large lens holder to the large hole on the right hand side of the board.
* Use the cut down M4 screw, a washer, and a nut.
* Orient the lens holder perpendicular to the long axis of the board.
* Tighten the nut and screw using a hex key (2.5 mm) and a spanner (7 mm).
* Mount the small lens holder and camera through the other hole.
* Mount it from the same side, and in the same orientation as the larger one.
* User another washer and nut but do not tighten completely yet.
* Remove the lens cover from the small end of the zoom lens, taking care not to touch the glass lens.
* Push the lens carefully into the large holder so that the small end points towards the camera cable slot.
* The small (threaded) end of the zoom lens should sit inside the smaller holder.
* Tighten the smaller holder so that it touches the lens.
* Add the elastic band around the camera and the larger lens holder to keep the two pressed firmly together. The main board may flex a little.

### Assemble the Raspberry Pi to the main board

#### Parts
* Raspberry Pi with (loosely fitted) stand-offs
* Main board with camera and zoom lens fitted
* 4 off M2.5 washers
* 4 off M2.5 nuts
* Raspberry Pi camera cable

#### Assembly
* Assemble the Raspberry Pi to the opposite side of the main board from the zoom lens.
* Push the stand-offs through the four holes; the micro SD card should be nearest to the slot in the main board.
* Tighten the stand-offs to the Raspberry Pi using a hex key (2 mm) and a spanner (5 mm).
* Assemble a washer and nut to the stand-offs to secure the Raspberry Pi to the main board.
* Make sure the edge of the Raspberry Pi board is flush with the longest edge of the main board. This will mean it sits as low down in the plastic case as possible and there will be enough room for the USB power connector at the top.
* Assemble the Raspberry Pi camera cable to the Raspberry Pi and the camera via the access slot in the main board.

### Final assembly

#### Parts
* Plastic case bottom (pre-cut and with captive USB power cable)
* Plastic case lid
* 4 off M3 x 10 countersunk head, hex socket screws
* USB mains electricity power adapter

#### Assembly
* Check everything on the main board is tight and straight.
* Check the micro SD card and memory stick are secure.
* Check the camera cable is secure.
* Remove the larger zoom lens cover; do not touch the lens.
* Slide the main board into the case bottom pointing the zoom lens towards the hole in the box, and with the Raspberry Pi micro USB power socket pointing up.
* Plug the power cable into the micro USB power socket on the Raspberry Pi.
* Before assembling the case top you may want to power up the system and check that it works and that you can still access it remotely.
* You may also want to leave the case open so that you can focus the lens once you have the camera installed in your location of choice. 
* Assemble the box lid using the screws; it may help to engage all of the screws' threads loosely before tightening.
